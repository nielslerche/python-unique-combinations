# Unique combinations with Python
I made this little script as a challenge for myself during our lecture on idea generation, which included a talk about morphologic analysis of configurations of a designed product. I wanted to see if I could make a program to help creatives easily make a configuration of multiple categories, then generate the unique combinations (or all total products), and put the results in a human-readable file. This is by NO MEANS a good implementation of such a low-level abstract process, but it is one I am proud of to have made, as I thought I had a very bad understanding of logic.
